# CustomCode

was given a project to create shells in the database from an excel sheet developed by process owners

developed the architecture along the way, which is why this was broken down in to so many tasks - plan was to refactor this code, 
outside of production. however - unable to design it with team as other priorities have taken over

lessons learned: 
-should have created more time to talk about architecture before designing the task
-needed to have a cleaner way to see what has been made before
-task run time is a bit longer (refactoring the multiple ifs/else statements)
-should have created a way to store csv in database then pull from there to possible decrease server load time (theory)
-ability for users to have more input in to what gets made and by whom
-ability for users to ignore certain rules
-ability to display duplicate rows in a better way for users to understand whent here are duplicate orders
